/**
 * A generic interface representing a k-d tree (k-dimensional tree) data structure.
 *
 * A k-d tree is a binary tree in which every node is a k-dimensional point. This data structure is used for
 * organizing points in a k-dimensional space. It is particularly useful for applications that involve
 * multidimensional search keys, such as range searches and nearest neighbor searches. Each node in the k-d tree
 * represents a point in k-dimensional space and partitions the space into two halves, each subtree representing
 * a subset of the points that fall within that partition.
 *
 * ## Properties and Methods
 *
 * The `KDTree` interface includes methods for:
 * - Finding the nearest neighbor to a given point.
 * - Finding multiple nearest neighbors to a given point.
 * - Performing range searches to find all points within a given radius of a center point.
 * - Performing range searches to find all points within a rectangular box defined by minimum and maximum points.
 *
 * ## Type Parameters
 *
 * - `T`: The type of the elements stored in the k-d tree. This could be any type, such as a custom data class
 *   or a basic type, that is associated with the k-dimensional points in the tree.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * To use a `KDTree`, you typically implement this interface in a concrete class that provides the specific
 * data storage and search algorithms. The implementation will manage the k-d tree structure and handle the
 * operations defined by the interface.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * class MyKDTree<T> : KDTree<T> {
 *     // Implementation details here
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Note
 *
 * The `KDTree` interface does not define how points are stored or managed. This is left to the implementing
 * class. The implementation may use various techniques to balance the tree, manage nodes, and optimize
 * search operations.
 *
 * Additionally, the k-d tree is optimized for specific types of queries. For instance, it is efficient for
 * nearest neighbor searches but may not be as efficient for certain types of range queries compared to other
 * data structures.
